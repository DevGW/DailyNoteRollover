# DailyNoteRollover Plugin for Obsidian

## Description

The DailyNoteRollover plugin automatically rolls over incomplete tasks from yesterday's daily note to today's daily note within Obsidian. Completed tasks are ignored, allowing you to focus on what still needs to be done.

## Installation

1. Open Obsidian
2. Go to `Settings > Community plugins`
3. Click `Install`
4. Search for "DailyNoteRollover"
5. Click `Install` on the correct plugin

## Usage

Once the plugin is enabled, it will automatically run when the workspace layout is ready. It will read yesterday's note, filter out completed tasks, and add the remaining tasks to today's note.

## Configuration

The plugin automatically queries the format of the daily note from the Obsidian core Daily Notes plugin. Make sure the Daily Notes plugin is installed and configured for this plugin to work correctly.

## Debugging

Debugging logs can be viewed in the developer console to assist in troubleshooting any issues.
